This is the new rlogin. It compiles out of the box on debian, weblinux, 
ubuntu and many others. There is a debian repository, just add the line 
'deb http://weblinux.sourceforge.net/debian-repo binary/' without the 
quotes to /etc/apt/sources.list on debian or derivitives (ubuntu and 
weblinux). Rlogin may not be as secure as ssh, but it is faster.
